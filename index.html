  <p>
    In my work, I deliberately refrain from predetermined content, motifs, or narrative intentions. 
    For me, the creative process does not begin with an idea, but with the material itself. I shape without planning. 
    This approach is an attempt to free myself from expectations, prejudices, and internalized images, 
    and thus becomes an act of resistance: against ideologies that subtly seek to embed themselves in our thinking, 
    against fixed meanings, and against the need for constant classification. My work is a space in which intuition 
    takes precedence and the material itself becomes a kind of compass. At the same time, I am aware that this process 
    also generates a new order—its own ideology of openness and indeterminacy. In order to shift or suspend this once again, 
    the exhibition space itself becomes a narrative medium. The individual works function as fragments, as variable components 
    of a narrative. The space shapes meaning just as the works shape the space. In this way, a network of relations emerges 
    that explains less than it questions—a temporary field in which perception and interpretation remain in motion.
